   I was tasked with fixing the format of the text response windows so that they did not run off the page on the right side.
   This needed to be done for both the Daily Report and Weekly Survey. These edits were done to the view files for those two items.
   This turned out to be an easy fix, requiring a change in the @cols property from 95 to 72. I also fixed the padding assigned
   to the 'Welcome...' line to bring it in line with the content below. A sample of the relevant code follows:


<div class="row">
                @Html.LabelFor(model => model.CourseItem, "Which Course and Item are you on? (For example: Python Course, Item 15.) ")
                @Html.EditorFor(model => model.CourseItem)
            </div>
            <br />
            <br />
            <div class="row">
                @Html.LabelFor(model => model.Help, "Do you need help with anything? (If so, please provide specifics and include when you'll next be available to connect with an Instructor.) ")
                @Html.TextAreaFor(model => model.Help, new { @class = "Help", @cols = 72, @rows = 10, @placeholder = "Write your response here" })
            </div>
            <br />
            <br />
            <div class="row">
                @Html.LabelFor(model => model.aFeedback, "In your studies, were there any positive experiences or successes today that you would like to share? ")
                @Html.TextAreaFor(model => model.aFeedback, new { @class = "aFeedback", @cols = 72, @rows = 8, @placeholder = "Write your response here" })
            </div>
            <br />
            <br />
            <div class="row">
                @Html.LabelFor(model => model.bFeedback, "Is there any other feedback you'd like to provide? ")
                @Html.TextAreaFor(model => model.bFeedback, new { @class = "bFeedback", @cols = 72, @rows = 6, @placeholder = "Write your response here" })
            </div>
            <br />
            <br />
            <div class="row">
                @Html.LabelFor(model => model.HoursT, "How many hours did you study today? ")
                @Html.EditorFor(model => model.HoursT)
            </div>
